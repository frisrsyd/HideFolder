## About HideFolder

<p>.bat file for hiding folder on windows OS</p>

## How It Works and How to Use It

First, it will ask you password that use for unhide/unlock the folder, then will create a folder named `"Private"` on the same directory as the `"hide.bat"` file, and then put folder or file that you want to hide inside the `"Private"` folder, and then run the `"hide.bat"` file again to hide the `"Private"` folder, and then the `"Private"` folder will be hidden, and to unhide the `"Private"` folder, you need to run the .bat file again and input the password that you have set before. If you forget the password, you can use IDE to open the folder where `"hide.bat"` file is located, and it will have `"password.txt"` file that contains the password that you have set before, you can open it and see the password or edit it. If you accidentally delete the `"password.txt"` file, just run the `"hide.bat"` file and it will ask you to set a new password and the `"password.txt"` file will be created again.

## How to Run
- Download the `"hide.bat"` file or clone this repository use this command `git clone https://github.com/frisrsyd/HideFolder.git`
- Set password: run the `"hide.bat"` file
- Hide folder: run the `"hide.bat"` file
- Unhide folder: run the `"hide.bat"` file
